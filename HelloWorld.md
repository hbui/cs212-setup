If this is the first time, tick Trust project in .... Then choose Trust Project so IntelliJ won't bother you again. After that, you should see your repository on your local computer.

There are 2 files. README.MD and HelloWorld.java

If you open HelloWorld.java you should see the source code.
Click on the run icon (which looks like a play button) on top. Your HelloWorld program should run and produce an output on the bottom.
