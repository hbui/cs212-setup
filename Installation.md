# Install the Required Programs
The first step to setting up your computer correctly for the course is installing the software that will allow you to write, compile, and run Java programs. All of the software in this course is free. **You only need to do this on your personal computer** The lab computers have these programs already.

## Step 1 Download and Install Java JDK
Download the SDK from [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

First, click on the operating system you are using (Linux, MacOS, Windows) and download the installer. After downloading, you should run the installer. Use all the default settings when installing.

## Step 2 Download and Install Git (You may have done it for CS 151 already)
Download Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Click on your operating system in the upper middle of the page to download the correct version for your computer. Then run the installer after it downloads.  Use all the default settings when installing.

If you are on a Mac, you should choose "installer" under "binary installer". Then choose Download, and then run the file that is downloaded (will need to run the .pkg file).  If this gives you a version that is not new enough for IntelliJ (IntelliJ will give you an error when you try to clone your repository), then you likely are running too old of a version of OSX and will need to update.
